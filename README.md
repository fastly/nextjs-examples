# nextjs-examples
Examples for using Next.js on Fastly Compute@Edge, using @fastly/next-compute-js.
These examples are for @fastly/next-compute-js version 2 or higher.

Because @fastly/next-compute-js works with Next.js versions 12.3.0 and 13.x,
there are examples for both next12 and next13, in their respective directories.
