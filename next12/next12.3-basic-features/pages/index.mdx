# @fastly/next-compute-js Demo Pages

This site is built using Next.js 12.3.0 on @fastly/next-compute-js v2,
and demonstrates various aspects of Next.js.

This page lives at `index.mdx` and is written using MDX.

## Routing

Next.js routes based on folder structure.

For more information, see [Routing](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/v12.3.0/docs/routing/introduction.md).

### Static files

Static File Serving (files in /public dir)
* `public/fastly.png` → [/fastly.png](/fastly.png)
* `public/favicon.ico` → [/favicon.ico](/favicon.ico)

### Simple and nested routes

* `pages/foo.js` → [/foo](/foo)
* `pages/foo2.js` → [/foo2](/foo2)
* `pages/routing/static/about.js` → [/routing/static/about](/routing/static/about)

### Index routes

The router will automatically route files named index to the root of the directory.

* `pages/routing/static/index.js` → [/routing/static](/routing/static)

### Dynamic routes

Next.js allows the use of brackets in the path. This allows you to match named parameters.

#### Segments

* `pages/routing/dynamic/simple/[id].js` → `/routing/dynamic/simple/:id`
  * [/routing/dynamic/simple/about](/routing/dynamic/simple/about) - `id` receives `'about'`
  * [/routing/dynamic/simple/hello](/routing/dynamic/simple/hello) - `id` receives `'hello'`

* `pages/routing/dynamic/[intermediate]/post.js` → `/routing/dynamic/:intermediate/post`
  * [/routing/dynamic/about/post](/routing/dynamic/about/post) - `intermediate` receives `'about'`
  * [/routing/dynamic/hello/post](/routing/dynamic/hello/post) - `intermediate` receives `'post'`

#### Catch-all routes

`[...args]` receives all remaining segments as an array. However, not specifying anything is an error.

* `pages/routing/dynamic/catchall/[...args].js`
  * [/routing/dynamic/catchall/a](/routing/dynamic/catchall/a) - `args` receives `['a']`
  * [/routing/dynamic/catchall/a/b](/routing/dynamic/catchall/a/b) - `args` receives `['a', 'b']`
  * [/routing/dynamic/catchall/a/b/c](/routing/dynamic/catchall/a/b/c) - `args` receives `['a', 'b', 'c']`
  * [/routing/dynamic/catchall](/routing/dynamic/catchall) (this is a 404)

#### Optional catch-all routes

`[[...args]]` is similar to the above, but does not result in an error if nothing is specified.
Dynamic Routed Pages - optional catch all
* `pages/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/[[...args]].js`
  * [/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/a](/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/a) - `args` receives `['a']`
  * [/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/a/b](/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/a/b) - `args` receives `['a', 'b']`
  * [/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/a/b/c](/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/a/b/c) - `args` receives `['a', 'b', 'c']`
  * [/routing/dynamic/optcatchall](/routing/dynamic/optcatchall) - No `args` param is created.

## HTML Generation

Next.js uses various techniques, both at build time and runtime, to generate
and deliver HTML to the visitor as quickly as possible.

### Static Generation

Next.js will statically generate as many pages entirely at build time as possible.
This is possible for pages that need no external services to build the page.

For example, this page is rendered statically:
* [/routing/static/about](/routing/static/about)

### Server-side Generation

If a page exports `getStaticProps()`, then that function is called at build
time, and returns props used to render the page component.
This is enough to render the entire page, so it is rendered statically
in this case as well.

Server Side Generation - with Static Props
* [/datafetching/props](/datafetching/props)

If a page has dynamic path segments (see Dynamic Routing above), and
exports `getStaticPaths()`, then that function is called at build time, and
returns the path segments that should be used to statically generate those pages.

`getStaticPaths()` must return an object that contains a `fallback` value, which
can be the string `blocking`, or one of the boolean values `true` or `false`.

#### Blocking

If `getStaticPaths()` returns `fallback: 'blocking'`, then pages specified in this way are
generated at build time. Other routes will have their page rendered at runtime.
This means that for those pages, nothing is generated at build itme, and the
visitor will incur a runtime wait until the content is rendered.

This rendered copy is then cached, so that future visitors will receive that copy
instead of having to wait.

Server Side Generation - with Static Paths (blocking)
* `pages/datafetching/paths-blocking/[id].js`
  * [/datafetching/paths-blocking/foo](/datafetching/paths-blocking/foo) - prerendered, and `id` receives `'foo'`
  * [/datafetching/paths-blocking/bar](/datafetching/paths-blocking/bar) - prerendered, and `id` receives `'bar'`
  * [/datafetching/paths-blocking/baz](/datafetching/paths-blocking/baz) - renders at runtime, and `id` receives `baz`

#### No fallback

If `getStaticPaths()` returns `fallback: false`, then only the pages generated statically
in this way are valid; other routes serve a 404.

Server Side Generation - with Static Paths (no fallback)
* `pages/datafetching/paths-nofallback/[id].js`
  * [/datafetching/paths-nofallback/foo](/datafetching/paths-nofallback/foo) - prerendered, and `id` receives `'foo'`
  * [/datafetching/paths-nofallback/bar](/datafetching/paths-nofallback/bar) - prerendered, and `id` receives `'bar'`
  * [/datafetching/paths-nofallback/baz](/datafetching/paths-nofallback/baz) - 404

#### With Fallback

If `getStaticPaths()` returns `fallback: true`, then pages specified in this way are
generated at build time. Other routes will have their page render a "fallback" version.

This fallback version can be used to display placeholders:
* The page’s props will be empty.
* With the router (`useRouter`), if the fallback is currently being rendered, `router.isFallback` will be true.

In the background, the server will continue to build a JSON representation of the props. Once this is ready,
the data will come across and populate the page.

Additionally, an HTML version of the page will be built.
This rendered copy is then cached, so that future visitors will receive that copy
instead of having to wait.

`fallback: true` behaves the same as `fallback: 'blocking'` under some circumstances.

For more details, see [Fallback pages](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/v12.3.0/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-paths.md#fallback-pages).

* `pages/datafetching/paths-fallback/[id].js` (with fallback)
  * [/datafetching/paths-fallback/foo](/datafetching/paths-fallback/foo) - prerendered, and `id` receives `'foo'`
  * [/datafetching/paths-fallback/bar](/datafetching/paths-fallback/bar) - prerendered, and `id` receives `'bar'`
  * [/datafetching/paths-fallback/baz](/datafetching/paths-fallback/baz) - placeholder page will render, then `id` receives `baz`

### Server-side rendering

If a page exports `getServerSideProps()`, then this function gets called at runtime, on the
server. The function generates values to be used as props to call the page component.

* `pages/datafetching/ssr/index.js`
  * [/datafetching/ssr](/datafetching/ssr)

### Client-side fetching

Next.js renders React components normally, so it's possible to use normal mechanisms such
as `useEffect()` with `fetch()` to fetch data after the component has loaded in the browser.

* `pages/datafetching/client-side/base.js` - Client-Side Fetching with `useEffect()` and `fetch()`
  * [/datafetching/client-side/basic](/datafetching/client-side/basic)

It's also often possible to use client-side fetching libraries, such as SWR from Vercel.

* `pages/datafetching/client-side/swr.js` - Client-Side Fetching with SWR
  * [/datafetching/client-side/swr](/datafetching/client-side/swr)

### API Routes

Routes under `pages/api` are called as "API Routes", and should return a JSON
rather than try to render a page.

* `pages/api/demo.js` → [/api/demo](/api/demo)
* `pages/api/hello/[name].js`
  * [/api/hello/John](/api/hello/John) - `name` receives `'John'`

## Client-side transitioning

Using either the `<Link>` component or the `router.push()` function,
you can transition to a new page without doing a full page refresh.

<Link href={'/foo2'}>Link to foo2</Link>, generated by Link tag (should not
cause a full page refresh).

## Shallow routing

Using the `router.push()` function, you can perform a "shallow" route,
which allows you to change the URL (so long as you stay on the same page)
without losing state.

The "Shallow route" button on the linked page performs shallow routing.
* [/foo](/foo)

## Headers

Headers can be specified in `next.config.js`.

For example, this application specifies the following:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/foo',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'x-custom-header',
            value: 'my custom header value',
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

Accessing this URL will add that header to the response.
* [/foo](/foo)

## CSS

* Global CSS
This page loads `/styles/globals.css` globally
(via the _app.js file).

* CSS Modules
This page also uses a CSS Module (`/styles/Home.module.css`) to apply the Inter font as well as
apply styles to the footer section.

A CSS Module (`/styles/MyComponent.module.css`) is used to style the `MyComponent` component described below.

## React Components for page composition

The following is a React component imported from the project tree at
/components/MyComponent.

<MyComponent />

## Font Optimization

This page loads the Inter font using [Font Optimization](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/v12.3.0/docs/basic-features/font-optimization.md).

The code snippet below exists in /pages/_document.jsx. This

```jsx
<Head>
  <link
    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter&display=optional"
    rel="stylesheet"
  />
</Head>
```

This feature expands the stylesheet and inlines it into the HTML output:
```html
<style data-href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter&display=optional">
  @font-face {
    font-family: 'Inter';
    font-style: normal;
    font-weight: 400;
    font-display: optional;
    src: url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/inter/v12/UcCO3FwrK3iLTeHuS_fvQtMwCp50KnMw2boKoduKmMEVuLyfMZs.woff) format('woff')
  }
  <!-- more -->
</style>
```

This works with hosted Google Fonts and Typekit web fonts, and avoids the round trip of having to fetch and resolve the stylesheet before
fonts are applied.

## Using MDX

This page is written using MDX. This requires certain packages and some setup that have been done in `next.config.js`.

For more information, see [Using MDX with Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/v12.3.0/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx.md).

The following page is also written in MDX.
* `pages/foo2.mdx` → [/foo2](/foo2)

## Custom Error Page

Attempting to access a non-existent page will render the 404 page.

Custom Error Pages -
* [/not-exist](/not-exist) - should render 404
