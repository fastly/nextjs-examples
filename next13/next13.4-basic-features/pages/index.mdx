# @fastly/next-compute-js Demo Pages

This site is built using [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) 13.4.6 on [@fastly/next-compute-js v2](https://github.com/fastly/next-compute-js),
and demonstrates various aspects of Next.js.

The code for this site is available for browsing on [GitHub](https://github.com/fastly/nextjs-examples/tree/main/next13/next13.4-basic-features).

This page lives at `index.mdx` and is written using MDX.

## Routing

Next.js routes based on directory structure.

For more information, see [Routing in the Next.js docs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/v13.4.4/docs/routing/introduction.md).

### Static files

Public Files (files in /public dir)
* `public/fastly.png` → [/fastly.png](/fastly.png)
* `public/favicon.ico` → [/favicon.ico](/favicon.ico)

### Simple and nested routes

A JavaScript file that exports a React component (or MDX file, if enabled)
will be routed similarly according to their directory structure.

* `pages/foo.js` → [/foo](/foo)
* `pages/foo2.js` → [/foo2](/foo2)
* `pages/routing/static/about.js` → [/routing/static/about](/routing/static/about)
* `pages/routing/static/text.mdx` → [/routing/static/text](/routing/static/text)

### Index routes

The router will automatically route files named index to the root of the directory.

* `pages/routing/static/index.js` → [/routing/static](/routing/static)

### Dynamic routes

Next.js allows the use of brackets in the path. This allows you to match named parameters.

#### Segments

* `pages/routing/dynamic/simple/[id].js` → `/routing/dynamic/simple/:id`
  * [/routing/dynamic/simple/about](/routing/dynamic/simple/about) - `id` receives `'about'`
  * [/routing/dynamic/simple/hello](/routing/dynamic/simple/hello) - `id` receives `'hello'`

* `pages/routing/dynamic/[intermediate]/post.js` → `/routing/dynamic/:intermediate/post`
  * [/routing/dynamic/about/post](/routing/dynamic/about/post) - `intermediate` receives `'about'`
  * [/routing/dynamic/hello/post](/routing/dynamic/hello/post) - `intermediate` receives `'post'`

#### Catch-all routes

`[...args]` receives all remaining segments as an array. However, not specifying anything is an error.

* `pages/routing/dynamic/catchall/[...args].js`
  * [/routing/dynamic/catchall/a](/routing/dynamic/catchall/a) - `args` receives `['a']`
  * [/routing/dynamic/catchall/a/b](/routing/dynamic/catchall/a/b) - `args` receives `['a', 'b']`
  * [/routing/dynamic/catchall/a/b/c](/routing/dynamic/catchall/a/b/c) - `args` receives `['a', 'b', 'c']`
  * [/routing/dynamic/catchall](/routing/dynamic/catchall) (this is a 404)

#### Optional catch-all routes

`[[...args]]` is similar to the above, but does not result in an error if nothing is specified.
Dynamic Routed Pages - optional catch all
* `pages/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/[[...args]].js`
  * [/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/a](/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/a) - `args` receives `['a']`
  * [/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/a/b](/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/a/b) - `args` receives `['a', 'b']`
  * [/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/a/b/c](/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/a/b/c) - `args` receives `['a', 'b', 'c']`
  * [/routing/dynamic/optcatchall](/routing/dynamic/optcatchall) - No `args` param is created.

## HTML Generation

Next.js uses various techniques, both at build time and runtime, to generate
and deliver HTML to the visitor as quickly as possible.

### Static Generation

Next.js will statically generate as many pages entirely at build time as possible.
This is possible for pages that need no external services to build the page.

For example, this page is rendered statically:
* [/routing/static/about](/routing/static/about)

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

export default function About() {
  const router = useRouter();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About this site</h1>
      <div>This is a Next.js site.</div>
      <div>Static Routing : /routing/static/about</div>
      <div>Query: {JSON.stringify(router.query)}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Server-side Generation

If a page exports `getStaticProps()`, then that function is called at build
time, and returns props used to render the page component.
This is enough to render the entire page, so it is rendered statically
in this case as well.

Server Side Generation - with Static Props
* [/datafetching/props](/datafetching/props)

```jsx
// This function gets called at build time
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const posts = [
    { title: 'foo' },
    { title: 'bar' },
  ];
  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  };
}
export default function Blog({ posts }) {
  if (posts == null) {
    return (<div>'null'</div>);
  }
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post, i) => (
        <li key={i}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

#### Revalidation

The object returned from `getStaticProps()` can optionally specify a `revalidate` value,
which can be a number, or the boolean value `false`.

If this is specified, then the content that is generated at build time is displayed to the
first visitor that accesses this file, along with the `x-vercel-cache: PRERENDER` header.
In the background, the server will render the newest version of the file and cache it,
to be served to subsequent visitors.

The cache will be alive for a number of seconds equal to the specified number, or indefinitely
if `false` is specified. Visitors will receive the cached copy, along with the
`x-vercel-cache: HIT` header.

After the cache has expired, the next visitor will receive the stale copy,
along with the `x-vercel-cache: STALE` header. In the background, the server will render
the newest version of the file and cache it, to be served to subsequent visitors.

The example below is a page that revalidates after 10 seconds.

Server Side Generation - with Static Props + revalidate 10 seconds
* [/datafetching/props-revalidate-10](/datafetching/props-revalidate-10)

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const time = new Date().toISOString();
  return {
    props: {
      time,
    },
    revalidate: 10,
  };
}
```

Server Side Generation - with Static Props + cache indefinitely
* [/datafetching/props-revalidate-false](/datafetching/props-revalidate-false)

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const time = new Date().toISOString();
  return {
    props: {
      time,
    },
    revalidate: false,
  };
}
```

#### On-demand revalidation

Files cached using the mechanism above can have their cache purged on-demand by
calling `res.revalidate(route)` from within an API route.

For example, to force the `/datafetching/props-revalidate-false` route above to revalidate,
call [/api/datafetching/props-revalidate-false](/api/datafetching/props-revalidate-false).

```javascript
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  await res.revalidate(`/datafetching/props-revalidate-false`);
  return res.json({ revalidated: true });
}
```

This will cause the cached copy to go stale, as well as cause the server to immediately render
the newest version of the file and cache it.

(*) Known issue - the re-render is not immediately triggered at the moment, and the cached copy goes
stale. The next visitor receives a stale copy and the cache is refreshed after the next visit.

### Static Paths

If a page has dynamic path segments (see Dynamic Routing above), and
exports `getStaticPaths()`, then that function is called at build time, and
returns the path segments that should be used to statically generate those pages.

`getStaticPaths()` must return an object that contains a `fallback` value, which
can be the string `blocking`, or one of the boolean values `true` or `false`.

The following sections show examples of using this.

#### No fallback

For example, the file at the path `pages/datafetching/paths-nofallback/[id].js` has the following `getStaticPaths()`
function:

```jsx
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const paths = [
    { params: { id: 'foo' } },
    { params: { id: 'bar' } },
  ];
  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false, // can be true, false, or 'blocking'
  };
}
```

If `getStaticPaths()` returns `fallback: false` as in this example, then only the pages generated statically
in this way are valid; other routes serve a 404.

Server Side Generation - with Static Paths (no fallback)
* `pages/datafetching/paths-nofallback/[id].js`
  * [/datafetching/paths-nofallback/foo](/datafetching/paths-nofallback/foo) - prerendered, and `id` receives `'foo'`
  * [/datafetching/paths-nofallback/bar](/datafetching/paths-nofallback/bar) - prerendered, and `id` receives `'bar'`
  * [/datafetching/paths-nofallback/baz](/datafetching/paths-nofallback/baz) - 404

#### Blocking

If the object returned by `getStaticPaths()` specifies `fallback: 'blocking'`, then the routes not specified will not be
generated at build time; rather, they would have their content rendered at runtime, and the visitor will incur a runtime
wait until the content is rendered.

This rendered copy is then cached, so that future visitors will receive that copy
instead of having to wait.

Server Side Generation - with Static Paths (blocking)
* `pages/datafetching/paths-blocking/[id].js`
  * [/datafetching/paths-blocking/foo](/datafetching/paths-blocking/foo) - prerendered, and `id` receives `'foo'`
  * [/datafetching/paths-blocking/bar](/datafetching/paths-blocking/bar) - prerendered, and `id` receives `'bar'`
  * [/datafetching/paths-blocking/baz](/datafetching/paths-blocking/baz) - renders at runtime, and `id` receives `baz`

#### With Fallback

If the object returned by `getStaticPaths()` specifies `fallback: true`, then the routes not specified will not be
generated at build time; rather, they will render a "fallback" version.

This fallback version can be used to display placeholders:
* The page’s props will be empty.
* With the router (`useRouter`), if the fallback is currently being rendered, `router.isFallback` will be true.

In the background, the server will continue to build a JSON representation of the props. Once this is ready,
the data will come across and populate the page.

Additionally, an HTML version of the page will be built.
This rendered copy is then cached, so that future visitors will receive that copy
instead of having to wait.

`fallback: true` behaves the same as `fallback: 'blocking'` under some circumstances.

For more details, see [Fallback pages](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/v13.4.4/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-paths.md#fallback-pages).

* `pages/datafetching/paths-fallback/[id].js` (with fallback)
  * [/datafetching/paths-fallback/foo](/datafetching/paths-fallback/foo) - prerendered, and `id` receives `'foo'`
  * [/datafetching/paths-fallback/bar](/datafetching/paths-fallback/bar) - prerendered, and `id` receives `'bar'`
  * [/datafetching/paths-fallback/baz](/datafetching/paths-fallback/baz) - placeholder page will render, then `id` receives `baz`

### Draft Mode

It's possible to set a cookie to make all requests bypass the cache. This is useful for
"draft mode" for example if your backend is a CMS and you want to be able to preview the site
with current content.

To do this, call `res.setDraftMode({enabled: true})` from within an API route.

For example, [/api/datafetching/draft-mode?mode=on](/api/datafetching/draft-mode?mode=on).

```javascript
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  await res.setDraftMode({enabled: true});
  return res.json({enabled: true});
}
```

You can turn it off too: [/api/datafetching/draft-mode?mode=off](/api/datafetching/draft-mode?mode=off).
Otherwise it will turn off automatically when you close your browser.

### Server-side rendering

If a page exports `getServerSideProps()`, then this function gets called at runtime, on the
server. The function generates values to be used as props to call the page component.

* `pages/datafetching/ssr/index.js`
  * [/datafetching/ssr](/datafetching/ssr)

### Client-side fetching

Next.js renders React components normally, so it's possible to use normal mechanisms such
as `useEffect()` with `fetch()` to fetch data after the component has loaded in the browser.

* `pages/datafetching/client-side/base.js` - Client-Side Fetching with `useEffect()` and `fetch()`
  * [/datafetching/client-side/basic](/datafetching/client-side/basic)

It's also often possible to use client-side fetching libraries, such as SWR from Vercel.

* `pages/datafetching/client-side/swr.js` - Client-Side Fetching with SWR
  * [/datafetching/client-side/swr](/datafetching/client-side/swr)

### API Routes

Routes under `pages/api` are called as "API Routes", and should return a JSON
rather than try to render a page.

* `pages/api/demo.js` → [/api/demo](/api/demo)
* `pages/api/hello/[name].js`
  * [/api/hello/John](/api/hello/John) - `name` receives `'John'`

## Client-side transitioning

Using either the `<Link>` component or the `router.push()` function,
you can transition to a new page without doing a full page refresh.

<Link href={'/foo2'}>Link to foo2</Link>, generated by Link tag (should not
cause a full page refresh).

## Shallow routing

Using the `router.push()` function, you can perform a "shallow" route,
which allows you to change the URL (so long as you stay on the same page)
without losing state.

The "Shallow route" button on the linked page performs shallow routing.
* [/foo](/foo)

## Headers

Headers can be specified in `next.config.js`.

For example, this application specifies the following:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/foo',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'x-custom-header',
            value: 'my custom header value',
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

Accessing this URL will add that header to the response.
* [/foo](/foo)

## CSS

* Global CSS
This page loads `/styles/globals.css` globally
(via the _app.js file).

* CSS Modules
This page also uses a CSS Module (`/styles/Home.module.css`) to apply styles to the footer section.

A CSS Module (`/styles/MyComponent.module.css`) is used to style the `MyComponent` component described below.

## React Components for page composition

The following is a React component imported from the project tree at
/components/MyComponent.

<MyComponent />

## Font Optimization

This site loads the Inter font using [Font Optimization](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/v13.4.4/docs/basic-features/font-optimization.md).

It is done by importing `next/font` to load the font:
```javascript
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
```

Then it's applied to the `<main>` tag of `_app.js`:

```jsx
  <main className={inter.className}>
  </main>
```

## Using MDX

This page is written using MDX. This requires certain packages and some setup that have been done in `next.config.js`.

For more information, see [Using MDX with Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/v13.4.4/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx.md).

The following page is also written in MDX.
* `pages/foo2.mdx` → [/foo2](/foo2)

## Custom Error Page

Attempting to access a non-existent page will render the 404 page.

Custom Error Pages -
* [/not-exist](/not-exist) - should render 404

## next.config.js Options

### Rewrites

Rewrites allow you to map an incoming request path to a different destination path. For example
* [/rewrites/1234](/rewrites/1234) will proxy [https://http-me.glitch.me/anything/1234](https://http-me.glitch.me/anything/1234)
* [/rewrites2/1234](/rewrites2/1234) will proxy [/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/1234](/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/1234)

```javascript
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return {
      beforeFiles: [
        // These rewrites are checked after headers/redirects
        // and before all files including _next/public files which
        // allows overriding page files
        {
          source: '/some-page',
          destination: '/foo',
          has: [{ type: 'query', key: 'overrideMe' }],
        },
      ],
      afterFiles: [
        // These rewrites are checked after pages/public files
        // are checked but before dynamic routes
        {
          source: '/non-existent',
          destination: '/routing/dynamic/simple/1',
        },
      ],
      fallback: [
        // These rewrites are checked after both pages/public files
        // and dynamic routes are checked
        {
          source: '/rewrites/:path*',
          destination: `https://http-me.glitch.me/anything/:path*`,
        },
        {
          source: '/rewrites2/:path*',
          destination: `/routing/dynamic/optcatchall/:path*`,
        },
      ],
    }
  }
}
```

### Redirects

Redirects allow you to redirect an incoming request path to a different destination path.
* [/about](/about) will redirect to [/](/)

```javascript
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/about',
        destination: '/',
        permanent: true,
      },
    ];
  }
}
```
